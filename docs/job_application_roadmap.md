# Job Application Roadmap — Tech & Stream Edition

This roadmap distils the "10 Things You MUST Do Before Applying For a Job" video into an actionable sequence for **Kevin Marville (Tech & Stream)**. Use it every time you consider a new mission, freelance gig, or partnership.

1. **Clarify the target**  
   Define the role, mission type (freelance, régie, conseil), and cultural environment you thrive in (mission-driven, remote-first, robotics-friendly). 80 % of the success happens before hitting "Apply".

2. **Refresh résumé & portfolio**  
   Align the CV, Malt/Upwork/Fiverr profiles, and Tech & Stream site to spotlight recent wins: ESP32 robotics lab, REST/GraphQL APIs, automation scripts, SEO content.

3. **Deep company reconnaissance**  
   Investigate the company's mission, products, tech stack, funding stage, and tone. Collect 2‑3 "hooks" to reference during outreach.

4. **Tailor the narrative**  
   Mirror the vocabulary of the announcement (e.g., REST, microcontrollers, React, CI/CD). Prepare a concise elevator pitch linking the problem to your hybrid web+IoT skillset.

5. **Highlight unique value**  
   Emphasise what differentiates you: full-stack execution, hardware integration, automation, content creation, and the Tech & Stream media reach.

6. **Quantify achievements**  
   Translate projects into metrics (conversion uplift, processing time saved, number of automations delivered, revenue impact). Prepare 2 mini case studies.

7. **Audit digital presence**  
   Ensure LinkedIn, GitHub, blog, Twitch/YouTube assets, and newsletter all reinforce the same positioning and include up-to-date showcases.

8. **Culture & story fit**  
   Craft a narrative explaining why you thrive in collaborative, high-output environments and how you partner with stakeholders.

9. **Prepare your “why”**  
   Answer why this company, why you, and why now. Integrate personal mission (Tech & Stream), technical ambitions, and timing or availability.

10. **Logistics & readiness**  
    Line up references, confirm availability, benchmark the target budget/TJM, rehearse discovery questions, and map the follow-up cadence post-application.

Keep this checklist in your Notion or CRM. Each box ticked before applying increases the probability of a fast, high-quality closing.
